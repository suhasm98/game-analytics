Sample App With Analytics Charts

We require a charting system that is informative and simple to navigate to display our current analytics data for our games.  Your task is to create this interface which will have time along the X axis and the selected datasetâ€™s scale on the Y axis.


# Features required are:
* ability to switch between datasets (e.g. different games, different events)
* ability to easily select date ranges and time periods
* display the data for a date range as a chart and a table
* plot a horizontal target line which changes colour when the last element in the date range is above or below that line. The user will require an interface to set the value of the target line and the line colour.

# Features Added:
* ability to switch between datasets (e.g. different games, different events) Added only two because the logic remains the same for other attributes except users
* ability to easily select date ranges and time periods
* display the data for a date range as a chart and a table
